Hey there, I'm Irteza. I'm a 4th year Mathematical Sciences student at the University of British Columbia. Mathematical Sciences is a joint degree offered by UBC's Math, CPSC, and Stats departments and features coursework in all three fields. I'm based in Calgary and Vancouver.

My interests are primarily in Software Development and Game Development. You can reach me with my email syedirtezashamsi@gmail.com


 - Starbound

Using the Unity Engine and C#, I solo-developed a top-down perspective 2D bullethell game named Starbound. Visual and Auditory assets were either repurposed from assets found in game asset stores or created in Aesprite/Audacity. I needed to design a strong OOP-based Class Hierarchy, data structures and design patterns to preserve practicality. Multivaritate algebra and geometry skills were needed to create interesting enemy bullet patterns and Coroutines were used to implement multitasking and sequentially sensitive operations. State Machines were useful for implementing enemy behaviours and player states. You can find a playable demo on my Itch.io page: https://sias888.itch.io/starbound.


- Charting Module

 A Charting Module made with Windows Forms written in C#. It prompts the user for a csv file, parses the data, cleans and processes it into DataViews and DataTables, and outputs various graphs with customizable axes and scales, allowing for zooming functionality. 


 - Menuing System

For my CPSC 210 project, I designed a working menuing system in Java. It allowed for users to change various visual aspects of a player character, auditory levels of sound effects and background music, as well as name the player character. The application saves the desired settings in JSON format and loads player configurations as desired. The project made use of Unit Testing to create robust methods.
